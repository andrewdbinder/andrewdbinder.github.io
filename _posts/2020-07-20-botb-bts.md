Each year, the Associated Students of Walla Walla University (ASWWU) puts on an event called Battle of the Bands. A group of student-led bands perform on stage and battle against each other, as one of the largest campus events of the year. Many hours of work are put into this event, by musicians, sound technicians, and event planners. Here, some of the behind the scenes efforts put on by the sound team to make this event happen will be discussed.

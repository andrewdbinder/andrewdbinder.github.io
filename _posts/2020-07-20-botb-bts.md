Each year, the Associated Students of Walla Walla University (ASWWU) puts on an event called Battle of the Bands. A group of student-led bands perform on stage and battle against each other, as one of the largest campus events of the year. Many hours of work are put into this event, by musicians, sound technicians, and event planners. Here, some of the behind the scenes efforts put on by the sound team to make this event happen will be discussed.

## Preperation

As with any event, I believe preperation is one of the most important. As the senior sound technician running front of house, I needed a way to make sure all crew members were on the same page. After auditions were completed and bands were chosen, I created a technical guide with specific information for all crew members. It consisted of a master patchlist, individual patchlists for each band, band members/order, and signal paths. This guide was printed out and given to all crew members. In past years, this information wasn't as readily accessible or in a state of change, and I wanted it to be a little more concrete. This guide can be seen [here](/img/botb/BOTB_2020.pdf)

## Front of House

Front of house was run by a "salvage" Yamaha M7CL. This board was replaced by a Yamaha CL5 at the University Church, after it began randomly freezing during events. Some of the other techs thought it was caused by the internal word clock, but I'm not convinced there was any way to prove this. I don't think it happened often enough to test. An external word clock was used, and the board ran great. As a contingency, we used a MixWizard 16:2 between the M7CL and the amps, just in case we did lose control of the M7CL, this gave a way to mute audio or play canned music while the board got restarted.

Matrices were set up for the different sets of speakers. These consisted of a main LR send, a mono sub send, and a send for the seperate DJ stage.
